# Upload your Map to WorkAdventure

:::info
As of May 2024, this is the recommended way of hosting your maps
:::

The WorkAdventure server can host your map files.

In the following sections, we will explain how to upload your map to the WorkAdventure server
from the command line (on your local computer), or from a CI/CD pipeline.

## Using the command line

The map starter kit is designed to help you upload maps from your computer to the map storage of WorkAdventure.

In order to use this package run the command in your terminal :

    npm run upload

On the first run, the command will ask you the URL to the server and your API key.
Where you get this depends on the kind of WorkAdventure server you are using.

  <TabItem label="SAAS version" value="saas" default>

1. **Your API Key:**  
   You can find it in [your admin account](https://admin.workadventu.re).  
   Log in.  
   In the left panel, click on "Developers" tabn then "API keys / Zapier".
   There you can create a new token. (Don't forget to save it !)

   ![Get your API Key](../../images/get_info_key.png)

2. **The URL of your map storage:**    
   The map storage is in the same section as the API Key above. There are 3 links, be careful to take the `Map-storage API endpoint`, it is the url for uploading files to the map storage service of WorkAdventure.

3. **Directory:**    
   You can also add a `directory name` if you want. It will be the folder where all your uploaded files will be stored in.
   If you leave this blank, there will be no directory.

<!-- 4. Upload Mode :
   The upload mode is the way you want to host your map. If your following this tutorial it mean you want to be hosted so you need to enter 1 to choose this mode of storage.
   If you have any doubt about your upload mode you can check here for the others options.
   [Build your Map with Tiled](index.md) -->

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Self-hosted" value="self-hosted">

**Your API Key:**

The system administrator that installed the WorkAdventure server should have provided you with an API key.

- For **docker-compose deployements**, it is the value of the `MAP_STORAGE_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN` environment variable.  
  Also, be sure to have the `MAP_STORAGE_ENABLE_BEARER_AUTHENTICATION` set to `"true"` in your `.env` file.
- For **Helm deployments** , it is the value of the `mapstorage.env.AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN` value in your `values.yaml` file.
  Also, be sure to have the `mapstorage.env.ENABLE_BEARER_AUTHENTICATION` set to `"true"` in your `values.yaml` file.

**The URL of your map storage:**

The map storage URL depends on your install.

- For **docker-compose deployments**, it should be `https://[workadventure-server]/map-storage/` if you are using the default configuration.
- For **Helm deployments**, it should also be `https://[workadventure-server]/map-storage/` if you are using `singleDomain: true` in your `values.yaml` file,
  or `https://mapstorage.[workadventure-server]` if `singleDomain: false` in your `values.yaml` file.

**Directory:**
You can also add a `directory name` if you want. It will be the folder where all your uploaded files will be stored in.
If you leave this blank, there will be no directory.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution Uploading maps overwrites existing files!
When you upload files to the WorkAdventure server, all the files in the directory specified will be removed
and replaced by your new files. If you keep the "directory" empty, this means that
all the files in your world will be removed and replaced by your new files.
:::

After answering these questions, the script will start to upload your directory. To be sure that it worked, you need to see something like this in your terminal : 'Upload done successfully'

Now for every change you only just have to commit and push all your changes ! Just wait a few minutes, and your map will be propagated automatically on your server.

:::info
Your settings have been saved in a `.env` file (except the API key that was saved in the `.env.secret` file). Should you need to change them, 
you can edit these files.
:::

## Understanding what is happening

When you run the `npm run upload` command, the following things happen:

- First, your map files are "built". During the build phase:
  - the tilesets of your map are optimized. Any tile that is not used is removed. This is done to reduce the total size of the map and results in faster loading times.
  - the scripts of your map are compiled and bundled. This happens if you developed some specific features on your map using the Scripting API.
    The compilation phase translates files from Typescript to Javascript.
    The bundling phase takes all the Javascript files and merges them into a single file.
  - The result of the built is written in the `dist` directory.
  - The content of the `public` directory is copied to the `dist` directory.
- Then, a ZIP file of the `dist` directory is created and sent to the WorkAdventure "map-storage" server.
  This server is in charge of hosting the map files. When it receives the ZIP file, it unzips it and stores the files
  in the directory you configured when you first ran the `npm run upload` command.  
  For each `tmj` file the server finds, it will check if there exists a matching `wam` file. If not, it will create one.
  `wam` files are used to store any part of the map edited in the inline map editor of WorkAdventure (like the list of objects or areas),.
  the microphone settings, etc...)

:::danger Backup your original files!
The WorkAdventure server only stores the "build" you send to it. It does not store the original files you used to create the map.
If you want to update your map, you need to update the original files on your computer and run the `npm run upload` command again.
Do not think you can get back the original files from the WorkAdventure server, because it stores only the "build".
It is your responsibility to store the original map files in a safe place in case you want to modify those.

:::info Wrapping things up
In this chapter, we saw how to upload your map from your local computer to the WorkAdventure server using the command line.
This works well and for small projects, this is probably the best way to go.
In the next chapter, a more robust way to store and work on your map files: a Git repository.
:::


## Using Git and a CI/CD pipeline

A great place to store your original files is in a Git repository (like GitHub or Gitlab). If you are a developer, you probably already know
Git. The Git repository offers the following advantages:

- you store your files **in a safe place**
- you can **work with other people** on the same map
- you can **track the changes** you made to the map
- you can **revert to a previous version** of the map if you made a mistake
- you can use a **CI/CD pipeline** (like "GitHub Actions") to automatically upload your map to the WorkAdventure server when you push changes to the repository.

The map starter kit comes with a GitHub Actions workflow that is designed to upload your map to the WorkAdventure server 
when you push changes to the `master` branch of your repository.

:::caution Git is complex
Git is a powerful tool, but it can be complex to use and is very targeted at developers. If you are not familiar with Git, 
you should probably start with the "command line" solution explained in the previous chapter.
:::

## Configuring you project for CI/CD

If you used the command line solution explained in the previous chapter, you will notice that the upload command generates
2 files:

- `.env` that contains the URL of the map storage
- `.env.secret` that contains the API key

The `.env` file can be commited to your Git repository. However, the `.env.secret` file should **never** be commited.
Indeed, it contains your API key, and if someone gets access to it, they can upload files to your map storage.

Instead, you should use the "secrets" feature of GitHub to store the API key. This way, the API key is not stored in the repository.

<details>
  <summary>Learn how to configure a secret in GitHub</summary>
  <div>

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Settings" tab  
   ![The settings tab](./images/github-settings.png)
3. Click on the "Secrets and variables" link in the left panel  
   ![The secrets link](./images/github-secrets-and-variables.png)
4. Click on the "Actions" link
   ![The actions button](./images/github-actions-menu.png)
5. Finally, click on the "New repository secret" button  
   ![The new repository secret button](./images/github-new-repo-secret.png)

  </div>
</details>

You should create a secret named `API_KEY` and paste your map storage API key there. See the [previous section](#using-the-command-line) to know how to get your API key.



## Troubleshooting

### Typescript error

If you are doing some development with the Scripting API, you may encounter Typescript errors when you run the `npm run upload` command.
Indeed, the `npm run upload` command first performs a build of your Typescript files. If there is a Typescript error, the build will fail.

The error message will be displayed in your terminal. You should fix the error and run the `npm run upload` command again.

:::note
When testing your script locally, you are using Vite. Vite is only transpiling Typescript files. It turns them into Javascript without doing any
actual type checking. This is why you can have **a working script locally and a failing build**.
:::

### Checking the dist directory

Remember the map uploaded to the WorkAdventure server is the content of the `dist` directory. If things are working
locally, but act strangely on the server (sound files not playing, HTTP 404 errors, etc...), you should check the content of the `dist` directory.

You can trigger a build of your map by running the following command:

    npm run build

Do not forget that if you want to put random files in the `dist` directory, you should put them in the `public` directory.
The content of the `public` directory is copied to the `dist` directory during the build phase.

### My map is not updated (using Git)

When you push changes to your repository, the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered. It will build your map and upload it to the WorkAdventure server.
If you see that your map is not updated, you should check the "Actions" tab of your repository to see if the workflow was triggered and if it failed.

Common reasons for the workflow to fail:

- the API key is not set in the secrets of your repository
- the URL of the map storage is not set in the secrets of your repository or in the .env file
- the build of the map failed (Typescript error, etc...)
- the workflow did not trigger (you are not pushing to the `master` branch, etc...)
